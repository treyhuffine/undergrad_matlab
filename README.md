# undergrad_matlab
This repository contains 2 MATLAB projects from my undergraduate degree. Keep looking around if you're not impressed, I've gotten much better in the years since!

### MATLAB Golf
This file is one of the first projects I ever create (roughly 5 years ago). The premise is an interactive and playable golf game using MATLAB's plotting feature.

### NE Final Project
This project is important to me because I was selected team leader, and we took first prize for undergraduate entries in the entire nuclear engineering department. To me this project is a good example of generating the necessary code for a desired outcome without specifically being assigned or told by a teacher what needed to be done and then executing effectively.
